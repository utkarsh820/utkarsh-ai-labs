## What Is This?

This is not a blog. This is a **publicly auditable training log** for a 6-month sprint through the entire production AI stack — from statistical foundations to deployed GenAI systems.

Every lesson has **LaTeX-grade theory**, every module has an **implementation lab**, and every week produces a **proof-of-work commit** on GitHub.

## The Architecture

| Month | Focus Area | Key Deliverable |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **1** | Mathematical Foundations | Statistical Validator utility |
| **2** | Classical ML & Feature Engineering | End-to-end Sklearn pipelines |
| **3** | Deep Learning & NLP | Transformer from scratch |
| **4** | MLOps & Deployment | CI/CD model serving pipeline |
| **5** | GenAI & LLM Engineering | RAG system with evaluation |
| **6** | Capstone & Portfolio | 15-project portfolio launch |

## Principles

!!! tip "The Three Laws of This Academy"

    1. **No passive consumption.** Every module ends with code you can `git commit`.
    2. **No hand-waving.** If there's a formula, it gets derived. If there's a claim, it gets benchmarked.
    3. **No hiding.** All progress is public. The [Dashboard](dashboard.md) tracks everything.
