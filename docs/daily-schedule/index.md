## 📅 The "AI Residency" Daily Schedule

**Goal:** 6-8 hours of deep, focused intellectual work per day.

| Time | Activity | Hardcore Phase Equivalent | High-Performance Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **06:00 – 06:30** | **Morning Review** | Squad Sync / Review | **Active Recall:** Write 5 key ideas from yesterday without looking at notes. |
| **06:30 – 08:00** | **DSA / LeetCode** | Daily Comp. Practice | Neetcode/Striver. **Strict 45 min** per problem, then review the optimal solution. |
| **08:00 – 08:30** | *Breakfast + Break* | — | Fuel up. |
| **08:30 – 10:30** | **Deep Work Block 1** | Concepts Drilldown | **Focus:** Video/Reading + Anki. Phone in another room. |
| **10:45 – 13:15** | **Deep Work Block 2** | Hands-On Application | **The Rule:** No tutorials. Build from a blank file. Break things to learn. |
| **13:15 – 14:00** | *Lunch + Decompress* | — | Rest your brain. |
| **14:00 – 16:00** | **Deep Work Block 3** | Project Build | Work on weekly project deliverables. Measurable GitHub commits only. |

| **17:00 – 18:00** | **Exercise** | Sports Time | **Non-Negotiable:** Run, gym, or walk. Physicality drives mental clarity. |
| **18:00 – 19:00** | **Wrap & Plan** | Daily Wrap | Review what you built, plan tomorrow’s 3 "Big Wins," 15 min Anki. |
| **19:00 – 20:00** | **Community / Proof** | Social/Industry Sessions | Post progress on LinkedIn/X. **Compound your assets.** |
| **20:00 – 21:00** | **Mock Prep / Certs** | Comp. Coding Hour | Rotate daily: ML theory, behavioral prep, or Cert study. |

### 🛡️ Why This Works

1. **Iterative Depth:** You aren't just watching videos; you are recalling (Morning), applying (Deep Work 2), and explaining (LinkedIn/Academy).
2. **Professional Visibility:** By 19:00 daily, you are building a "Digital Paper Trail" that recruiters find through Google search.
3. **Physical Integrity:** The 17:00 exercise slot prevents the burnout that kills most 6-month learning journeys.
