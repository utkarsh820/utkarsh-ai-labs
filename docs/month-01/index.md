# Month 1 — Mathematical Foundations

> **Objective:** Build the mathematical spine that every ML system rests on. No shortcuts.

## Modules

| # | Module | Status | Proof of Work |
|---|--------|--------|---------------|
| M0 | [Statistics & Probability](module-00-statistics/index.md) | :material-progress-wrench: Active | `statistical_validator.py` |
| M1 | Linear Algebra for ML | :material-clock-outline: Upcoming | — |
| M2 | Calculus & Optimization | :material-clock-outline: Upcoming | — |
| M3 | Information Theory Basics | :material-clock-outline: Upcoming | — |

## Month 1 Completion Criteria

- [x] All four modules have at least one implementation lab
- [ ] All proof-of-work scripts committed to GitHub
- [ ] Summary notebook connecting all four domains to a single ML pipeline
