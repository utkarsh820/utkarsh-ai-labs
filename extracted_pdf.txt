1.2  What Employers Actually Look For in 2026 (Based on 1000+ Job 
Postings) 
🔵  ML ENGINEER — Core Must-Haves: 
• Python (expert) + PyTorch / TensorFlow 
• Model training, eval, deployment, serving 
• FastAPI / REST API development 
• Docker + Git (non-negotiable)

• Data visualization (matplotlib/seaborn/Plotly) 
• Business communication + stakeholder mgmt 
• ML model lifecycle: train → eval → deploy 
• Cloud data platforms (BigQuery/Redshift) 
 
Data Scientist roles value VERSATILE 
GENERALISTS who speak both business and 
code. 
SQL depth is the most common interview filter. 
84,000+ jobs listed in India right now. 
 
🟣  AI ENGINEER — Core Must-Haves:

⚠️  THE ONE REAL IITGN ADVANTAGE YOU MUST REPLICATE 
Their BIGGEST structural advantage is not the curriculum — it's the ENVIRONMENT: 
• Daily accountability: squad syncs at 8:30 AM, competitive coding hours at 7:30 PM 
• Social pressure: 59 other driven peers around you every day 
Confidential Strategic Plan  •  6 Months  •  ₹6 Lakh Saved  • India needs 1M AI professionals by 2027—be one. 
ELITE AI MASTERY PLAN v2.0  •  Beat IITGN-CDF  •  ML Engineer | Data Scientist | AI Engineer 
• AI Clinic: real enterprise problems assigned to you — no choice but to execute 
• All-nighter sprints, weekly coding tournaments, demo days — maximum intensity 
 
YOUR REPLICATION STRATEGY: 
1. Find 1-3 accountability partners (Discord, LinkedIn, local meetup)—check in daily 
2. Join Kaggle competitions on a DEADLINE—simulates the AI Clinic forcing function 
3. Book AWS exam 3 months out — non-refundable. Now you MUST prepare 
4. Post publicly on LinkedIn every Sunday: 'Week X done—here's what I built.' 
5. Apply to lablab.ai hackathons—48-72h sprints with real teams and deadlines

🎯 THE 300+ PROBLEM STRATEGY (Exactly Matching IITGN-CDF) 
Target: 350+ total by end of Month 5. Breakdown below: 
• Month 1: 75 Easy (arrays, strings, hashmaps) — build speed and confidence 
• Month 2: 50 Medium (two pointers, sliding window, binary search) — pattern recognition 
• Month 3: 60 Medium (trees, graphs, BFS/DFS) — MOST common in ML engineer interviews 
• Month 4: 50 Medium-Hard (DP, backtracking) — differentiator for FAANG/GCC roles 
• Month 5: 65 Medium-Hard (mixed review + contest participation) — interview simulation 
• Month 6: 50 Hard (for ML Eng roles at top companies) — optional but powerful 
Platform priority: LeetCode > HackerRank SQL > Codeforces (for competitive edge) 
CRITICAL: After every problem you fail, write the solution explanation in YOUR OWN WORDS 
 
MONTH 6 — Capstone + Portfolio Blitz + Career Launch  [Weeks 22–26 ]  
+50 Hours 
 
IITGN-CDF ends with a capstone, demo day, placement support, and GitHub portfolio building. You do the 
same, but your work is PUBLIC and globally visible. Their demo day is for 60 peers. Your demo is the entire

07.  Certification Battle Plan (They Have None; You 
Have 7+) 
IITGN-CDF graduates with a PG Diploma and IIT Executive Alumni Status. These have brand value in India 
but zero global recognition. Your certifications are globally recognized and directly map to ML Engineer and 
Data Scientist JD requirements.

💡 EXAM BOOKING STRATEGY: Book the exam 6 weeks before you plan to take it. The ₹14,000 
non-refundable fee is the most powerful motivator you have. This is exactly what IITGN-CDF's 
residential environment does—creates accountability through commitment. 
💰 TOTAL CERT COST: ~₹46,000–₹50,000 (mostly AWS/GCP exam fees). This is 10x cheaper than a 
single month of IITGN-CDF hostel fees. And these certs are globally valid for 3 years.
